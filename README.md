### Editing templates
Editing a template is an easy-to-do task. You only need to open the file ``` index.html ``` in a text editor and change a few HTML lines. No sweat!

#### Creating a ZIP file
To create the ZIP file necessary to upload the in-app template in the platform, please select all the following items and with a right-click of a mouse select the option *Compress Items*.

```
index.html
definition.json
CSS(folder)
images(folder)
```

**Please do not create a ZIP file using the whole folder otherwise the system would be able to load the in-app template correctly!**
