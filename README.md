### Editing templates
Editing a template is an easy-to-do task. You only need to open the file ``` index.html ``` in a text editor and change a few HTML lines. No sweat!

#### Text Editors
By default the MacOS comes with a text editor **TextEdit**. However, I would recommend installing **[Sublime Text](https://download.sublimetext.com/Sublime%20Text%20Build%203126.dmg)** in your machine. It has a far more intuitive interface and it highlights the HTML syntax, making it easy to spot what needs to be changed in the file.

Step-by-step instructions\
    1. Navigate to *02-Codes > 02-Editables* and open one of the in-app templates.\
    2. When inside an in-app template folder open ```index.html``` on text editor of your choice.\
    3. In the ```index.html``` locate the following lines of code:```<h1>Discover Paris</h1>``` and ```<p>The best of Paris in your pocket? Download the update to discover the new edition's address.</p>``` \
    4. Edit the text in-between the tags\
    5. Locate the button/s label/s, if any, and do the same as above, editing only the text in-between tags.
    6. To upload a new image just, add the images in the folder labeled *images*,and change the source path in the HTML file.
    7. Save and exit file using CMD+S followed by CMD+W.

Do not create a ZIP file using the whole folder, otherwise it will not work.

### OS Support
This feature is still undergoing development, therefore some unforeseen bugs or errors might when visualising the in-app template in different devices. This spreadsheet indicates the most up-to-date iOS and Android  OS version support for each one of the templates.
